				I am Sebastian Hanus. From a young age I have been interested in things such as science, programming, engineering, art and math. For this reason my sister, <a href="http://phprime.mit.edu/">Patricia</a>, and I started a <a href="http://academy.qualityone.us/">science club</a> where I have learned a large variety of life skills such as teamwork and problem solving. However it is more of a STEAM club (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math). I have also done many science fairs that have taught me about science, problem solving, and presenting. My goal in life is to increase the net amount of happiness in existence and the breadth of it's distribution.<br><br>
